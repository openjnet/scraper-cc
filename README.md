# scraper-cc
This is a Python script that uses Playwright to scrape Wikimedia Commons to get the number of video results from all countries of the world.

world_countries_list.csv: initial scrape from World Bank list of countries

world_countries_list_semi-cleaned.csv: cleaned halfway using code

new csv [replace this with name of the csv]: this will be the version of the previous one which will have manually changed names
